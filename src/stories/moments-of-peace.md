Aether’s sword precisely swings, finally killing the last enemy and sealing off the Wild Hunt for the time being. He pants as his sword returns to its sheath, “Finally… over…”

The Lightkeepers are still low in numbers after everything with Dottore, so Aether decided he would help deal with some of the monsters and lighten the load on them. As he was talking to a Lightkeeper, briefing him on what had just happened, he realised he was only a short walk away from the Final Night Cemetery.

It’s been a while since Aether last saw Flins, and since Paimon was with Lauma and the Frostmoon Scions, he thought, “Why not?”

He finished up, and waved to the Lightkeepers on duty as he stepped away.

He strolled leisurely, enjoying the fresh air and gentle breeze. It’s been a while since he’d had some alone time to just… think. Free from the hustle and bustle. He absolutely loved Paimon of course, but he also valued his alone time.

Aether walked past the Experimental Design Bureau, and before long he had reached the tip of Flins’ Cemetery. The gold searched for a few moments before he spotted the one he was looking for, reassuring some of the Ghosts who lay beneath the ground.

Flins slowly turned with a kind smile on his face as he heard Aether’s footsteps, “Dear Traveller, what brings you to my humble abode?”

The Traveller always loved the way Flins made him feel, he felt so safe, like he completely trusted the lightkeeper. It was the only person who he could fully let his guard down with and be… himself with. He approached his friend, “It’s been a while since I’ve seen you, and I was in the area so… I thought I would stop by,” He smiled, “I hope I’m not intruding…”

“Not at all,” he waved his hand, “Come, sit. Would you like anything to drink? Some tea perhaps?”

“Just water, thank you,” he yawned as he leaned back into the chair, staring out over the island, letting the peacefulness of the moment settle with him. The ghosts, while eerie, seemed to carry their own calm energy, like echoes of forgotten stories and long-lived lives. It reminded him of how far he’d come since waking up in Mondstadt, how much he’d seen, and now only Snezhnaya was left.

Flins returned with a glass of water and set it on the small wooden table next to him, before resigning to the other chair.
His eyes linger on Flins for a moment, noting how the lightkeeper’s figure seemed to glow softly. The slight breeze tousled Flins’ hair just a bit, adding an almost ethereal quality to him. Aether’s heart beat just a bit faster as the thought that he could spend a quiet moment like this with someone who made him feel so… truly at ease.

Flins sat across from him, his gaze soft and steady. “I’m most glad you came, Aether,” he said, his voice carrying the weight of something deeper, something he didn’t often say aloud. “It’s been far too long since we shared a moment such as this.”

Aether chucked softly, a small smile tugging at his lips. “Yeah, it has. You know, I’ve missed this… us. Just sitting, talking… without anything else weighing us down.”

The lightkeeper’s smile grew warmer, his eyes sparking with a fondness that made the other’s chest tighten, in a good way. “You mustn't have to carry the weight of the world alone. Not while I am here.”

Aether’s heart skipped a beat. The honesty in Flins’ words, the way he seemed to mean every syllable, he couldn’t help but feel the spark between them, like an invisible thread drawing them closer with every passing moment.

Flins leaned forward slightly, his expression still gentle, almost tender. “I am always here for you, Aether. Whether you require someone to talk to, someone to fight alongside you, or simply someone to be in silence with.” His voice was quiet, sincere. “I’m glad you trust me.”

Aether’s gaze softened, his fingers tracing the edge of his glass as he thought about it for a moment. He wanted to say more, to express everything he was feeling in that moment, but the words felt like they were caught in his throat.

Instead, he smiled softly, his voice barely above a whisper, “I trust you Flins… more than anyone.”

The moment hung in the air, both of them quietly understanding the weight of it.

Flins leaned back, his smile never fading, but there was now a hint of mischief in his eyes. “Well, if you ever require respite from all the disarray, this cemetery will always be here… and I shall be here, too.”

Aether couldn’t help but let out a small laugh, though his heart felt full. “That sounds... nice. Maybe one day, I’ll take you up on that offer.”

Flins looked at him for a moment, then leaned just a little closer, his voice soft and teasing. “I’ll be waiting... with tea, and maybe something sweet to share.”

Aether’s smile widened at the thought. “I’d like that,” he said, the weight of his words more than just an invitation. He wasn’t sure what the future held, but for now, sitting here with Flins, everything felt perfect. Just this moment. Just this.

The soft rustle of the ghosts around them, the stillness of the evening, and the warmth between them felt like everything Aether needed. Just for tonight, he didn’t need to worry about anything else. Not the looming battles, the endless mysteries, or the weight of the world. He had Flins. And for now, that was enough.
