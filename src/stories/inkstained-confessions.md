> Hello! This is my first fan fiction so sorry if its not perfect or too short! Enjoy!

Kaveh lets out a loud sigh and groans, “Something’s off… what is it,” His
frustration is clear in the tight curl of his shoulders.

Alhaitham clears his throat softly, causing Kaveh to jump and drop his pencil.
“A-Alhaitham,” he says, eyes wide and cheeks red.

Alhaitham shrugs and takes a half-step closer. He points at Kaveh’s sketch,
tracing a smooth line with his finger. The gesture was quiet, steady.

Kaveh looks at Alhaitham. “That… that actually helps,” he says.

Alhaitham nods at Kaveh. “You overthink too much,” he softly runs his fingers
through Kaveh’s gold hair, “Maybe you need to take a break.. When was the last
time you ate?”

Kaveh looks away, embarrassed. He’s been pulling all-nighters and forgetting to
eat, fully focused on finishing this design before the deadline. Just like he
used do at the Akedemiya.

“It feels like I’m back at the Akedemiya. When my studies got busy, I used to
pull all-nighters in the study hall trying to finish my blueprints” Kaveh reminisced.

He rests his heavy head on his desk and closes his eyes for a few seconds before
snapping back upright, finally letting out a soft breath.

“Sorry,” he murmurs, avoiding eye contact with Alhaitham.

Alhaitham simply nods and gently places his warm hand on Kaveh’s shoulder,
“Don’t be, lets get you something to eat.”

He gently grabs Kaveh’s hand and guides him to a small table in their kitchen.
Kaveh pulls out a chair and slumps down into it.

Alhaitham places a small glass of water on the table, “Here, the food won’t be long.”

Kaveh grabs the glass in his shaky hands and takes a sip before putting it back
down. He looks at a simple watch on his wrist.

“I’m so sorry for keeping you up at this time… please go to sleep if you’re
tired…” He whispered softly to Alhaitham.

“No, you’re eating first,” Alhaithaim places a plate of assorted cheese, bread,
and fruit on the table for Kaveh to eat, “Eat up.”

He sits on the other chair, watching him eat, before commenting, “You know, you
don’t need to be so formal… We’ve been roommates for years now.”

Kaveh glances away, jaw working as he smooths his sleeve. His shoulders tilt
inwards, posture stiff. Though he keeps his words courteous, the tension is enough
to show how he’s obviously hiding something. Alhaitham is perceptive enough to
pick up on Kaveh’s weird actions.

Alhaitham sighs before softly saying, “Kaveh, I know you’re hiding something.”

Kaveh’s heart speeds up, thumping loudly. Alhaithim continues, “Recently, you’ve
always been responding so formally…” 

Kaveh can’t hide it anymore.

“I think you should stop hiding your feelings for me… I can see right through
you, you know,” Alhaitham smirks, gently grabbing Kaveh’s chin, forcing him to
look at his face.

“I- I have no idea what you’re talking about!” Kaveh protests, closing his eyes
in embarrassment.

Before Kaveh can even think to back away, Alhaithaim pulls him in closer, lips
almost touching, “I can’t lie anymore, Kaveh.”

Kaveh’s breath hitches. His chest tightens as Alhaithaim's proximity fills the
space between them. A faint scent of ink and resin lingers, a reminder of his
late night sketches.

Alhaitham’s fingers trace Kaveh’s jawline delicately. Kaveh’s eyes flutter open
just enough to meet Alhaithaim’s intense gaze.

“I’ve been trying to–” Kaveh begins, voice barely a whisper, but there’s no
hiding it anymore.

Alhaithaim’s smirk softens, eyes looking directly into Kaveh’s. “Don’t be afraid,”
he murmurs, his breath touching Kaveh’s cheek.

Kaveh’s shoulders relax slightly, but his heart is still pounding out his chest.
He slowly lifts his hand and grabs Alhaitham’s wrist, anchoring himself to this moment.

A quiet pause stretches, two hearts pounding. The silence brimming with confession.

Alhaitham leans in, slowly, deliberately, “If you admit it,” he breaths,
“I’d meet you halfway.”

Kaveh swallows, “Okay,” he whispers back. And their lips meet. The moment is
perfect, passionate, like it was always meant to happen. Kaveh wants this moment
to last forever.

Alhaithaim pulls away, gasping for air, “Kaveh–,” he starts.

Kaveh interrupts him, “I love you!” he blurts out, blushing.

“I was going to say, you’ve got ink all over your hand.”
